          Best Practices for JPG to PDF Conversion
        </h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          To get the best results from your <strong>JPG to PDF conversion</strong>, keep these tips in mind:
          Use high-resolution images for the clearest PDF output. If you're scanning documents, set your scanner
          to at least 300 DPI. For photographs, the original camera resolution usually works perfectly.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When choosing page settings, <strong>A4 is the standard for most countries</strong> while Letter size
          is common in the US. The "Auto" option is great when your images are all different sizes — it creates
          pages that match each image's dimensions perfectly. Use the "Contain" fit mode to ensure nothing gets
          cropped, or "Fill" to use the entire page area.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our tool preserves image quality throughout the conversion process. Unlike other converters that heavily
          compress your images, we maintain a high quality setting (92% JPEG quality) that keeps your images looking
          sharp while still keeping file sizes reasonable. This makes our tool ideal for converting
          <strong> photos to PDF</strong>, scanning documents, and creating <strong>image portfolios in PDF format</strong>.
